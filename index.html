            <h2>Biography</h2>

                27,1968,Cambridge,England) was an austrian physicist who contributed to the dicovery of nuclear fission
                and was amongst the first to isolate the isotope protactinium-231 after a three decades of work along
                with Hahn. She is the first women in Austria to earn a doctorate in physics .
